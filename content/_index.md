# Hi, I'm Jacob

 {{ avatar_home() }}

I am a Software Engineer based in NYC and remotely on _The Internet_.

My focus is on building powerful user-first software. I am passionate about privacy,
cryptography, user interface design, and art history.

Previously I worked on bringing End to End Encryption to the Zoom Video platform.

Before that I worked with the amazing Keybase team (aquired by Zoom), where we created a fully encrypted file system,
chat, key infrastructure, and more!

My work consists of designing excellent user interfaces as well as implementing 
technical systems including cryptographic protocols and key exchange. Exposing
complexity though simple design is my joy in Software Engineering.

I am an avid endurance athlete, cyclist, backpacker, and rock climber. Recently, I have hiked the Pacific Crest
Trail, bikepacked the west coast of the United States, and summited several mountains; more to come!
