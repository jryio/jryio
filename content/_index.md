# Hi, I'm Jacob

 {{ avatar_home() }}

I am a Software Engineer based in NYC and remotely on _The Internet_.

My focus is on building powerful user-first software. I am passionate about privacy,
cryptography, user interface design, and art history.

Previously I worked on bringing 
[End to End Encryption to Zoom video calls](https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-rolling-out-end-to-end-encryption-offering/).

Before that I worked with the amazing [Keybase](https://keybase.io) team 
([acquired by Zoom](https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-joins-zoom)), where we
created a fully encrypted [file system](https://book.keybase.io/files),
[chat](https://book.keybase.io/chat), [key infrastructure](https://book.keybase.io/account), 
and [more](https://keybase.io/blog/crypto)!

My work consists of designing excellent user interfaces as well as implementing 
technical systems including cryptographic protocols and key exchange. Exposing
complexity though simple design is my joy in Software Engineering.

I am an avid endurance athlete, cyclist, backpacker, and rock climber. Recently, I hiked [600 miles of The Pacific Crest
Trail](https://jakeby.land) and [bikepacked the pacific coast](https://jryio.travelmap.net/pcb-2022) of the United States.
