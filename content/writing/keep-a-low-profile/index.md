Keeping a low profile online is an important and lost skill. We have
collectively decided that we prefer to plaster our most sensitive thoughts,
moments, and media over the digital airspace.


Avoiding drawing attention to one self online is an art. Knowing how much to
share, where, and with whom should be a foundational internet literacy skill.
Eating a hamburger may feel good, but we all know we're inching closer to
obesity with each bite.


As I write more on this site, the premise will be about keeping a low profile. I
have no expectations for high readership or feedback. I want to enjoy the web,
making things for it, and playing with new tools.
