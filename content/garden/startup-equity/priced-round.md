Also known as Preferred Stock Financing, this is a mechanism whereby an investor contributes capital in exchange for stock in a privately held company.

The rate of capital to stake in the company is determined by a negotiated valuation of that company.

There is a **Price Per Share** price at which the investor purchases the shares the company.

A [Priced Round](@/garden/startup-equity/priced-round.md) required more negotiation and legal work to determine the valuation of the company, as opposed to something like a [Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE)](@/garden/startup-equity/simple-agreement-for-future-equity-safe.md).

When an early-stage company does not have a set valuation, or when a founder does not want to give investors preferred stock in exchange for capital, the company may raise an unpriced round, which commonly involves an investor providing cash or a loan in exchange for a [convertible security](https://carta.com/blog/convertible-securities) (convertible).

The two most common types of convertible securities are [SAFEs](https://carta.com/blog/pre-money-and-post-money-safes/) (Simple Agreements for Future Equity) and convertible notes.

Convertible securities are then automatically converted to actual equity shares at a later time, during the first priced round.
