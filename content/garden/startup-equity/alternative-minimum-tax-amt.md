## How the Alternative Minimum Tax Works

The difference between a taxpayer's alternative minimum taxable income and his AMT exemption is [taxed using the relevant rate schedule](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/tax/09/refundable-amt-credit.asp). This yields the tentative minimum tax (TMT).

If the tentative minimum tax is higher than the taxpayer's regular [tax liability](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxliability.asp) for the year, then they payÂ the regular tax and the amount by which the tentative minimum tax exceeds the regular tax. In other words, the taxpayer pays the full tentative minimum tax.

There are two alternative minimum tax rates, 26% and 28%. For 2022, the 28% rate applies to the excess alternative minimum taxable income of $206,100 or more for all taxpayers ($103,050 for married couples filing separate returns). For 2023, the 28% rate applies to the excess alternative minimum taxable income of $220,700 or more for all taxpayers ($110,350 for married couples filing separate returns). The 26% rate applies to incomes up to those levels.

A taxpayer who has a high income and uses large tax breaks may owe a smaller percentage under the standard rules. If so, the taxpayer is obliged to recalculate the taxes owed under the alternative minimum tax system, which eliminates some of those tax breaks.

The taxpayer will owe whichever amount is higher.7
