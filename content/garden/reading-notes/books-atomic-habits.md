> # Make it Obvious

1. Fill out a Habit Scorecard. Write down your habits to become aware of them
2. Use implementation intentions: `I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]`
3. Use habit stacking: `After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]`
4. Design your environment, make the cues of good habits obvious and visible

> # Make it Attractive

1. Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do
2. Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior
3. Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit

> # Make it Easy

1. Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits
2. Prime the environment. Prepare your environment to make future actions easier
3. Use the Two-Minute rule. Downscale your habits until they can be done in two-minutes or less
4. Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime purchase that lock in future behavior.

> # Make it Satisfying

1. Use reinforcement. Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete your habit
2. Use a habit tracker. Don't break the chain of consecutive habit completions.
3. Never miss twice. When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately.
