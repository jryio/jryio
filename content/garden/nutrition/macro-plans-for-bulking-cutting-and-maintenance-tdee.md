I have calculated some macro plans based on my age, weight, height, and activity level. These plans are useful for selecting between [Bulking, Cutting, Recomping](@/garden/nutrition/bulking-cutting-recomping/index.md).

I have used the following tool to give multiple different macronutrient plans based on which diet I am currently following: [TDEE Calculation (25, M, 188cm, 80kg, Moderate, 16%)](https://tdeecalculator.net/result.php?s=metric&age=25&g=male&cm=188&kg=80&act=1.55&bf=16&f=1)

How ripped could you get? According to [Martin Berkhan's formula](https://archive.is/xyrPA), your maximum muscular potential is **88 kg** at 5% body fat. Most people have no desire to be 5% body fat though, so you'd be **92 kg** at 10% body fat & **97 kg** at 15% body fat. These numbers are good goals to aim for if you are bulking up!
