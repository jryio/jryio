We want to warm up before exercises because it prevents injury and aids our lifting. Warming up should achieve an **increased body temperature**, **increase blood flow**, and **increase oxygen availability**.

However be careful not to perform too much static stretching before a workout because [Static Stretching Before Weight Lifting Can Reduce Muscular Performance](@/garden/weightlifting/static-stretching-before-weight-lifting-can-reduce-muscular-performance.md). This is because [Lifting Require Tendons to Contract Again Heavy Loads.](@/garden/weightlifting/lifting-require-tendons-to-contract-again-heavy-loads.md).

Perform static stretches for muscle groups that will not be exercised during the workout. This allows for increased flexibility in unused/resting muscle groups such that the working muscle groups will not elongate.

# Warm Ups

1. Light cardio that raises heart rate high enough to break a sweat. We want to have an increased temperature to help with blood flow, flexibility, and injury prevention.
2. Stretch to increase range of motion. If parts of the body are tight, we don't want to extend injuries to those areas during a lift. Use a lacrosse ball or foam roller to elevate some of the tightness.
3. Perform warmup sets before a workout. This will help with having good form, priming the muscles, and building [Mind-Muscle Connection](@/garden/weightlifting/mind-muscle-connection.md)
