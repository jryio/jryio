When performing exercises, it is crucial that the target muscle group is activated and being contracted because [Contracting A Muscle Is the Only Way It Will Grow](@/garden/weightlifting/contracting-a-muscle-is-the-only-way-it-will-grow.md).

In order to facilitate muscle contractions, studies have found that directing your attention towards the target muscle group will increase the contractions of that muscle.

When instructions for an exercise are framed as "*squeeze your glues*" or "*pull with your back*" then muscle gains over an eight week period can be as much as 12% than baseline.

This is central idea in mind-muscle connection, to focus your attention towards activating the muscle rather than lifting the weight. By thinking about what it **feels like** to contract our target muscle group, we have a better chance of improved muscle gain.
