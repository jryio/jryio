## Rules of Linear Progression

1. Use a [1RM%](@/garden/weightlifting/1rm.md) calculator to determine your approximate 1RM value (first several sessions)
2. For Lower Body Workouts, Progress by 5kg Per Session
3. For Upper Body Workouts, Progress by 2kg Per Session
4. [Maintain Weight When Reps Cannot Be Completed](@/garden/weightlifting/maintain-weight-when-reps-cannot-be-completed.md)
5. [Reduce Weight by 10% After Two Consecutive Failures](@/garden/weightlifting/reduce-weight-by-10-after-two-consecutive-failures.md)

## How to Combine [RPE](@/garden/weightlifting/rpe.md) & [1RM%](@/garden/weightlifting/1rm.md)

Example

*So, if one day you have **Squat 3×8** @6-7 RPE (67.5-72.5% 1RM) programmed for example, but the weight feels heavier than usual today, and though you can get your target of 8 reps, you feel that you could only have performed one more rep (which would be an RPE of 9, not 6-7), then you’ll reduce the weight you lift for the next set to around the level where you will hit your RPE target. You’ll then finish any subsequent sets using that weight.*
