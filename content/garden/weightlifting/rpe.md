> # Rating of Perceived Exertion

- RPE is a measurement of **how many reps you will stay short of failure.** An RPE of 8 means **stop the set when you could perform 2 more reps**.

1st Set RPE means how many reps short of failure you should do on your **first set.**  If you do this right, though your subsequent sets will be harder, you should be able to use the same load for all your sets.
   - ::10::  Could not do more reps or load without form failure
   - ::9.5:: Could not do more reps, could do slightly more load
   - ::9::   Could do 1 more rep
   - ::8.5:: Could definitely do 1 more reps, chance at 2
   - ::8::   Could do 2 more reps
   - ::7.5:: Could definitely do 2 more reps, chance at 3
   - ::7::   Could do 3 more reps
   - ::5-6:: Could do 4-6 more reps
   - ::1-4:: Very light to light effort
