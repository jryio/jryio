Referred to as "Main Lifts", these are lifts that work multiple muscle groups by moving multiple joints at once. For example Conventional deadlifts move several joints at once: hip, knees.

Compound exercises work the most muscles per repetition and constitute the majority of our lifts.

Muscles that are not worked at all or may be underdeveloped should be worked using [Isolation Exercises](@/garden/weightlifting/isolation-exercises.md).
