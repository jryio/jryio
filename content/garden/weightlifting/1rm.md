# One Rep Maximum Percentage

One rep maximum percentage is a useful measurement in weightlifting to set difficulty when performing exercises. The basic idea is that you first compute your (1RM) One rep maximum and then take a smaller fraction of that weight for your exercises.

This helps avoid exhaustion by always performing at your maximum. It is also helpful as a relative weight scale for different people (no absolute weights necessary).

- 1RM stands for the percentage of your 1-rep maximum
- The percentage is a guideline for when you start the program only
