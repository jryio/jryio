It is important to learn proper exercise form because it will help us lift heavier weights in the future.

We can have better lifting form if we limit the number of exercises we perform. This gives us more time to focus on perfecting form of some lifts.

It is important not to overwork ourselves by doing too many exercises at first, this is because our [Work Capacity](@/garden/weightlifting/work-capacity.md) is limited but will increase over time

There are two types of lifts we should consider when choosing exercises. [Compound Exercises](@/garden/weightlifting/compound-exercises.md) will work several different muscle groups at once. While [Isolation Exercises](@/garden/weightlifting/isolation-exercises.md) will exercise a single muscle group centered around a joint.

### Novice Exercise Selection

As a novice, what is important is to focus on four main compound exercise groups
1. Squat Variants
2. Hip Hinge Variants
3. Horizontal Pull & Horizontal Push
4. Vertical Pull & Vertical Push

Introduce compound exercises gradually. What is most important is to gain familiarity and practice with proper form which will unlock further exercises.
