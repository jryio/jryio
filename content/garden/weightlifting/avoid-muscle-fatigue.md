Muscle fatigue occurs because the body uses energy and glycogen as energy to contract and expand the muscle. After exerting during a workout, lactic acid builds up in the muscle which eventually converts into lactate - this causes the muscles to become acidic and feel fatigued.

To avoid muscle fatigue, properly nutrients need to be supplied to the body. It is recommended to ::increase your intake of carbohydrates to restore glycogen to your muscles (which is depleted after a workout).::

Also essential is to ::never workout on an empty of full stomach. Have a snack about two hours before working out. Eat a full meal within one hour of exercising.::

Drinking water throughout the day as well as during a workout will help with electrolyte repletion and replenishing water lost due to sweating. ::It is recommended to drink approximately 2.5 L of water throughout the day.::

Getting a full night's sleep is also important to rest and recovery. The body will not recovery from a workout with too little sleep. Try to ::get a full 8 hour of sleep.::

If you do not feel fully recovered, tight, or injured - do ::low intensity light workouts like walking, running swimming, or yoga.::
