> If you think about it, making a muscle-tendon unit more compliant and forcing it to ‘relax’ so that it elongates, intuitively seems to conflict with the goal of making it contract against heavy loads.

This is still an inconclusive idea as increased static stretching may reduce injury overall but reduce muscular performance because [Lifting Require Tendons to Contract Again Heavy Loads.](@/garden/weightlifting/lifting-require-tendons-to-contract-again-heavy-loads.md)
