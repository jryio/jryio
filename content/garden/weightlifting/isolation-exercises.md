Referred to as "Accessory Lifts", these are lifts that work a small number of muscles because only a single joint is moving (isolated). For example a Dumbbell bicep curl is a bicep isolating exercise because the only movement is at the elbow.

Lifts of this type are used to bring up other muscle groups that may be missed or underdeveloped from our [Compound Exercises](@/garden/weightlifting/compound-exercises.md).
