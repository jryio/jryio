# My Photography Workflow

1. > ## Capture

Take photographs on my [ðŸŒ± Photography](@/garden/photography/photography.md#fujifilm-x-t4) camera body with any number of my lenses. Priorities when capturing are **::focus::** and  **::composition::**.

   **::focus::** means ensuring that focus is not drifting between subject and background and that the correct depth of field is achieved

   **::composition::** means positioning subject, background, and balancing open space with intentionality - *think before taking the shot!*

---

2. > ## Externalize

::External Drive::

Move photographs from SD cards to external SSD/HDD to avoid data loss. This alleviates storage pressure on SD cards and allows for reuse of cards in a single trip.

Import from SSD to iPad in a single transfer after obviously bad photos are deleted.

---

3. > ## Pick

::Lightroom::

Using Lightroomâ€™s culling feature of **::pick & reject::** a filter down photographs. After finalizing a set of photographs, deleted the rejected ones from Lightroom.
