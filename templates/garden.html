  ğŸ‘‹ Welcome to my <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">Digital Garden</a>.
</p>
<p>
  A Digital Garden is a collection of ideas which are deeply inter-linked, and (importantly) <i>backlinked</i>.
  This means that if a note in the garden has any references pointing to it, they will apear at the bottom of
  the page under "<i>Backlinks</i>". This exposes how ideas are connected.
</p>
<p>
  Feel free to peruse around the garden. If you would like a guide to the garden
  start with <a href="/garden/guide">The Guide</a>.
